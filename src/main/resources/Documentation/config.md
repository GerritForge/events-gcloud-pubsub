Configuration
=========================

The events-gcloud-pubsub plugin is configured by adding a plugin stanza in the
`gerrit.config` file, for example:

```text
[plugin "events-gcloud-pubsub"]
    numberOfSubscribers = 6
    subscriptionId = instance-1
    gcloudProject = test_project
    privateKeyLocation = /var/gerrit/etc/secured_key.json

```

`plugin.events-gcloud-pubsub.gcloudProject`
:   GCloud [project name](https://cloud.google.com/docs/overview#projects)

`plugin.events-gcloud-pubsub.subscriptionId`
:   Conditional. This value identifies the subscriber and it must be unique within your
    Gerrit cluster to allow different Gerrit nodes to consume data from the
    stream independently. It can be omitted when `gerrit.instanceId` is
    configured, otherwise it is mandatory.
    Default: `gerrit.instanceId` value (when defined)
    See also: [gerrit.instanceId](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/config-gerrit.html#gerrit.instanceId)

`plugin.events-gcloud-pubsub.privateKeyLocation`
:   Path to the JSON file that contains service account key. The file
    should be readable only by the daemon process because it contains information
    that wouldnâ€™t normally be exposed to everyone.

`plugin.events-gcloud-pubsub.numberOfSubscribers`
:   Optional. The number of expected events-gcloud-pubsub subscribers. This will be used
    to allocate a thread pool able to run all subscribers.
    Default: 6

`plugin.events-gcloud-pubsub.ackDeadlineSeconds`
:   Optional. The approximate amount of time (on a best-effort basis) Pub/Sub waits for
    the subscriber to acknowledge receipt before resending the message.
    Default: 10

`plugin.events-gcloud-pubsub.subscribtionTimeoutInSeconds`
:   Optional. Maximum time in seconds to wait for the subscriber to connect to GCloud PubSub topic.
    Default: 10

`plugin.events-gcloud-pubsub.streamEventsTopic`
:   Optional. Name of the GCloud PubSub topic for stream events. events-gcloud-pubsub plugin exposes
    all stream events under this topic name.
    Default: gerrit

`plugin.events-gcloud-pubsub.sendStreamEvents`
:   Whether to send stream events to the `streamEventsTopic` topic.
    Default: false

`plugin.events-gcloud-pubsub.retainAckedMessages`
:   Whether to retain acknowledged messages in subscriptions. This will cause
    [additional storage costs](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/replay-overview#subscription_message_retention).
    Note, that topics used for sharing events should retain acknowledged messages
    to allow new subscribers, e.g. new Gerrit sites, to replay the most recent
    events and bring their site up-to-date.
    Default: true

Gerrit init integration
-----------------------

The @PLUGIN@ plugin provides an init step that helps to set up the configuration.
